- Currently all counties in Colorado is allowed three commissioners, but there was a vote recently about whether large counties should be allowed to have five commissioners rather than three. We could run some experiments to see different commissioner representation outcomes in the three seat case vs the five seat case.

- Eg1., looking at the data there's ~90% white and ~10% hispanic population in Jefferson. We could design some generative experiments to see the outcomes of hispanic representation for commmissioners in three seats vs five seats.

- Eg2., We could also investigate redistricting plans in GerryChain for what proportion of seats Dem vs Rep for three commissioners vs five commissioners
